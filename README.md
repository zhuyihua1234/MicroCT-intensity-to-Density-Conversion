# MicroCT-intensity-to-Density-Conversion
Convert voxel intensity to density in (g/cm^3) for ORS Dragonfly microCT Images

To convert every pixel's intensity into density in (g/cm^3) in microCT, use "microCT_intensity2density_Dragonfly_Map.m"

To convert a particular pixel's intensity reading into density in (g/cm^3) in microCT, use "microCT_intensity2density_Target_Intensiy.m"
